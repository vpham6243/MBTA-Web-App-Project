# MBTA-Web-App-Project

This is the base repository for Web App project. Please read the [instructions](instructions.md) for details.

Team Members: Vicky and Kimia
Project Overview:
This project allows a user to enter any location in Boston on the home page and after clicking submit, the user is then directed to the results page. Here the user sees the nearest station to the location that they entered, whether that station is wheelchair accessible, and the weather. Beyond the scope of the main requirements, we added a static picture that displays all the routes included in the MBTA, the weather of the location is also displayed on the results page, and there is an interactive map that shows where the nearest station is. We also changed colors and fonts to make the website more aesthetically pleasing.

Reflection:
1. Development Process:
The first step of the process was the backend of the project and doing this first helped us make sure that all of the code worked perfectly before the front end was implemented.
*Reflect on topics such as project scoping, testing, debugging, and any specific challenges encountered*
3. Division of Labor:
The project was divided by back end and front end. Kimia covered the back end of the project using python and ensured that all of the code was working while Vicky handled the front end that used Kimia's code to create an interactive website. I think this worked out well in terms of division of labor and thought that it was fair in terms of the amount of work that was put in my both members. Doing this also made sure that we did not have any overlapping code that interfere with each other when it was finally pushed to github.
5. Learning:
