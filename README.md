# MBTA-Web-App-Project

This is the base repository for Web App project. Please read the [instructions](instructions.md) for details.

Team Members: Vicky and Kimia
Project Overview:
This project allows a user to enter any location in Boston on the home page and after clicking submit, the user is then directed to the results page. Here the user sees the nearest station to the location that they entered, whether that station is wheelchair accessible, and the weather. Beyond the scope of the main requirements, we added a static picture that displays all the routes included in the MBTA, the weather of the location is also displayed on the results page, and there is an interactive map that shows where the nearest station is. We also changed colors and fonts to make the website more aesthetically pleasing.

Reflection:
1. Development Process:
The first step of the process was the backend of the project and doing this first helped us make sure that all of the code worked perfectly before the front end was implemented. It was both rewarding and challenging - getting the API's to connect and function correctly was the trickiest part. It was a meticulous process because you could not forget simple characters like a question mark or slash. Integrating the OpenWeatherAPI was the hardest challenge, as we could not get it to work for around the first ten tries, leaning to ChatGPT for help.
3. Division of Labor:
The project was divided by back end and front end. Kimia covered the back end of the project using python and ensured that all of the code was working while Vicky handled the front end that used Kimia's code to create an interactive website. I think this worked out well in terms of division of labor and thought that it was fair in terms of the amount of work that was put in my both members. Doing this also made sure that we did not have any overlapping code that interfere with each other when it was finally pushed to github.
5. Learning:
We learned that it is important to build and test functions one by one rather than writing everything as once. It was super important to break the project down in small milestones, for example, seamlessly integrating the APIs. From a learning standpoint, we learned how powerful API's can be in providing real time information, like train and weather. Using Chat GPT made a huge difference in the efficiency and learning of our project. It helped us debug errors when the error was not clear, as well as getting the clean examples for the API URL formatting. Overall, ChatGPT definetly helps when you are stuck with errors and need an extra hint or push.
In the PNG File we pasted, it shows a screenshot from ChatGPT telling us we have been calling the wrong expression, causing us to keep getting errors. We were calling the URL that doesn't strip spaces, which was the issue we were having.
